What is Document Engine?

Nutrient Document Engine enables server-side document processing, rendering, and real-time collaboration. It offloads heavy processing from client devices and enables features like multi-user annotation synchronization.

Prerequisites

• Docker Desktop (or container runtime)

Step 1: Create docker-compose.yml

In the project root directory, create a file named docker-compose.yml with the Document Engine configuration.

This file is already included in this project. You can find it at the root level with pre-configured settings for Document Engine and PostgreSQL database.

Step 2: Start Document Engine

From the project root directory, run:

docker compose up

Wait for the message: 'Access the web dashboard at http://localhost:5001/dashboard'

Step 3: Upload a Document

1. Visit http://localhost:5001/dashboard
2. Login with username: dashboard and password: dashboard-password
3. Click Add Document and upload a PDF
4. Navigate to http://localhost:5001/dashboard/documents
5. Copy the Document ID (e.g., 7KPS8X13JRB2G841X4V7EQ3T2J)
